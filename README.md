# AIM:
To create,verify configure a Repository File in RHEL
# ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Start the Terminal: Open the terminal window in your Red Hat Linux environment.
### Step 2:
Navigate to the YUM Repository Directory. Move to the directory where all repository configuration files are stored, which is /etc/yum.repos.d/.
### Step 3:
Create a New Repository File. Create a new file named classroom.repo using a text editor with administrative privileges.
### Step 4:
Add Repository Details. Inside the file, define two repositories — one for AppStream and one for BaseOS — by specifying their names, base URLs, and enabling them while disabling GPG checks.
### Step 5:
Save and Exit the File. Save the changes made to the file and close the editor.
### Step 6:
Clean the YUM Cache. Clear any existing metadata or cached data to ensure the new repository information is recognized properly.
### Step 7:
Verify the Repository Configuration. Display the list of repositories to confirm that the newly created AppStream and BaseOS repositories appear in the output
